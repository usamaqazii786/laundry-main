### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Easily add an extra layer of protection to your WordPress sites with Defender's two-factor authentication (2FA) features. Including: mobile app verification (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy), backup code generation, lost device emails, WooCommerce 2FA, Biometric Authentication (fingerprint/facial recognition), and Hardware Key Authentication (USB security keys). Easily prevent brute force attacks and login security vulnerabilities.

### Login Protection

Brute force attacks are no match for Defender. Limit login attempts so hackers can't guess passwords. Permanently ban IPs or trigger a timed lockout after a set number of failed login attempts. Use Geo IP blocking to ban users from specific countries or locations.

### Firewall and IP Manager

Improve your website security with Defender's IP manager and firewall. Manually block specific IPs, import a list of banned IPs, and set automated timed and permanent lockouts. Defender makes it easy to block and unblock specific locations quickly thanks to its advanced firewall (WAF) offering Geographical IP blocking.

### User Agent Banning

Add user agents to the block or allowlist and stop bad bots from spamming and scraping your site. All major search engines and special network bots are allow-listed out of the box. Easy to set up, Defender's user agent banning tool does all the security work, with no editing of the .htaccess file required.

### Google reCAPTCHA Integration

Add reCAPTCHA to your login / registration pages, lost password forms, and post comments in a couple of steps to up security and help protect from fraud and abuse. Select reCAPTCHA type, language, location, and style to suit. As well as Google, Defender also supports the following reCAPTCHA types:

* BuddyPress reCAPTCHA
* WooCommerce reCAPTCHA

### Login Screen Masking

Defender makes it easy to move your login screen to a custom URL. Not only does login screen masking improve security, but it also lets you white label your login user experience and improves branding. 

### Force Password Reset

Force all users with selected roles to reset their password at any time. Especially helpful if you suspect a possible data breach on your site.

### Security Headers

Protect your site against common attacks, such as: XSS, code injection, cross site scripting, and more. Enable the following headers:

* X-Frame-Options
* X-XSS-Protection
* X-Content-Type-Options
* Strict Transport
* Referrer Policy
* Permissions-Policy

### 404 Limiter
Detect when bots are being used to scan your site for vulnerabilities and shut them down. The 404 limiter lets you stop the scan by detecting when a bot keeps visiting pages that do not exist, which can also save you from a giant strain on your site's performance.

### Notifications and Reports
Defender runs surveillance and sends security notifications with information that matters. All activity and notifications are recorded in the activity log to let you see at a glance the website security actions that have been taken by the Defender security plugin.

### Reduce Setup Time With Saved Configs

Save your Defender configurations and reapply them to your other sites in just a few clicks. You can create and save an unlimited number of security configurations.

### Pwned Password Check

Entered passwords are checked against public database breach records. If a password is identified as compromised, the user will be asked to change it.

### Global IP Block/Allowlists

Create your IP block/allow list once, then apply and automatically sync it to all your other sites with just a single click. Save hours by not having to manually add IPs to each individual site. *Note: a [free WPMU DEV account] (https://wpmudev.com/register) is required to access this feature.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I choose Defender over other security plugins? =

Defender is built to add all the best hardening and website security recommendations used by the pros without having to become a security expert. This means you get all the most effective and proven protection methods other services provide with fewer settings, on-click hardening and faster setup.

= Is Defender the only step I need to take in securing my WordPress site? =
Hackers and bot attacks are not the only threat to your site.  No matter what security plugin or service you use, always be prepared with a secure backup stored in a safe location away from your live site. Security does not protect from hosting outages, server errors and accidentally lost or damaged data. We recommend [Snapshot](https://wpmudev.com/project/snapshot/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=defender-readme&utm_content=snapshot#trial). Defender with scheduled managed backups is the best way to keep your site safe.

= Does Defender protect against harmful bots? =

Yes! Defender's Firewall gives you robust site protection and security by allowing you to block bad bot IPs and use geographical IP blocking

= Can I use Defender with other security plugins? =

You can. Just make sure not to enable the same security features in the third-party plugin that you also have enabled in Defender, as this might cause conflicts, such as malware scanners, firewall, and login security features.

= Is Defender compatible with WordPress Multisite? =

Yes! The plugin is fully compatible with a multisite installation. It can be network enabled and managed from the network admin.

= Does Defender offer spam protection? =

A high percentage of Trackbacks and Pingbacks are spam. Defender allows you to easily disable both, giving you added security and protection.

= Will my site be protected from DDoS attacks? =

Yes. Defender's IP banning, IP lockouts, and 404 detections can identify DDoS attacks and block bad IPs.

= I've locked myself out of my admin panel, what can I do? =

Add the code below to your theme's function.php file, which you'll find in the main directory of an active theme. Replace "YOUR IP HERE" with your IP address. Use a site like [whatsmyip](https://www.whatsmyip.org/) to get your IP.

`
add_filter( 'ip_lockout_default_whitelist_ip', function ( $ips ) {
  $ip    = 'YOUR IP HERE';
  $ips[] = $ip;
  return $ips;
} );
`

= Help! I was already hacked. What should I do? =

Freshchat plugin is a seamless way to add your Chat to your website.

== Description ==

Speak to all your WordPress site visitors and users to increase sales, collect feedback and provide support. For setup instructions, [go here](https://support.freshchat.com/support/solutions/articles/229810-wordpress-plugin).

Modern messaging software that your sales and customer engagement teams will love.

1.Not your typical bot. Meet your new sales sidekick.

Engage proactively with those who matter with contextual and timely messages. Let the bot kick in to capture leads, validate and qualify responses, and auto-upload them into your CRM. Customize bot messages to set the right expectations.

2.Get all the context you need to sell smarter

With events timeline, user information, and social profiles, know who you're talking to and what they are up to. Bring in information from external tools like CRM or order management systems for more context.

3.Reduce churn, increase adoption

Talk to your users before itâ€™s too late. Set up in-app campaigns to onboard and educate new users, or retain and re-engage lapsing customers. Send announcements, get feedback, and share product best practices right inside the product to close the loop effectively and maximize impact.
